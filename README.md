# Project: Orx Vice

Third person shooter made with the Orx open-source game engine

The project is called Orx Vice because I suck at thinking of names (I don't even know why I chose this name). It uses the Orx library and it was inspired by something Hotline Miami. I did not write the Orx library and this project has no affiliation to the Orx project. To avoid confusion, the final release will likely receive a different name. I'm thinking "Pixel Shootout" but I'm open to suggestions.

This is my first attempt at using Orx. The project might never reach a deployable state, but let's stay optimistic shall we? (Optimism is something I do not have a lot of)

Project available under GPLv3. Orx library available under Zlib. See LICENSE for more details.
