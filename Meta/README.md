# Orx Vice

Third person shooter made with the Orx open-source game engine

This is my first attempt at using Orx. The project might never reach a deployable state, but let's stay optimistic shall we? (Optimism is something I do not have a lot of)

Project available under GPLv3. Orx library available under Zlib. See LICENSE for more details.
